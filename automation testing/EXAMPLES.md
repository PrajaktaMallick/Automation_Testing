## üí° Tips for Writing Effective Tests

### 1. Be Specific with Selectors
Instead of: "Click the button"
Use: "Click the 'Submit' button" or "Click the button with id 'submit-btn'"

### 2. Add Verification Steps
Always verify that actions completed successfully:
```
1. Click the "Login" button
2. Verify the page contains "Welcome" or "Dashboard"
```

### 3. Handle Dynamic Content
For content that loads dynamically:
```
1. Click the "Load Data" button
2. Wait for 3 seconds
3. Verify the data table is populated
```

### 4. Use Screenshots for Visual Verification
```
1. Navigate to the homepage
2. Take a screenshot
3. Click the menu button
4. Take a screenshot to compare
```

### 5. Test Both Success and Failure Paths
Create separate tests for:
- Valid inputs (success path)
- Invalid inputs (error handling)
- Edge cases (boundary conditions)

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Keep tests focused**: One test should verify one specific functionality
2. **Use descriptive names**: Test names should clearly indicate what's being tested
3. **Add context**: Include the target URL and brief description
4. **Verify outcomes**: Always check that actions produced expected results
5. **Handle waits**: Add appropriate waits for dynamic content
6. **Clean up**: Log out or reset state when needed
7. **Document assumptions**: Note any prerequisites or setup requirements
